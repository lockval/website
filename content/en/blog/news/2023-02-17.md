A few days ago, Lockval Engine released the first message on the Internet for the first time, and received good discussions and feedback. I am very grateful to Hacker News for giving me this opportunity.

The link at that time was as follows:

Additionally, Lockval has made minor changes and improved documentation pages.

Next, we need to demonstrate the functionality of cron and write a document about it.

I hope that Loclval Engine will become the Unity and Unreal Engine of the backend in the future
